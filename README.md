# Vlad Sydorenko's music projects

# Getting Started
You need [Cakewalk by Bandlad](https://cakewalk.bandlab.com/) and [Kontakt](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-5/).

Each project depends on different `kontakt` libraries.
Just open a .cwp in `cakewalk` and you'll see a message with missing libraries.
